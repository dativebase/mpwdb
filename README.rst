This repository contains documentation_ and source code to help with building
morphological parsers with DativeBase. DativeBase_ is software for language
documentation and linguistic analysis. A morphological parser is a tool (a
piece of software) that takes words as input and returns an analysis of those
words into their parts. For example, the English word *unbreakable* might be
parsed into *un-*, meaning 'not', *break*, and *-able*, meaning 'able to be
*verb*\ ed'.
